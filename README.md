# What's Cookin'? 

This was the first paired project for the second module of the Turing Front End Development Program. We were tasked with creating a meal preparation application that would focus on both Test Driven Development and Object Oriented Programming. To build the application we used Javascript. 

This application allows a user to track the meals they would like to cook and informs them if they need additional ingredients and their approximate cost. 

### See the Application

### Testing 

For this application we utilized the mocha and chai libraries.
